An easy, simple and quick online resume/personal page. Currently under heavy development but feel free to [sign up](https://beta.resulite.com/register) or contribute!

# ðŸ‘± Example:
You can check out my personal resulite page @ https://rutger.resulite.com though one could also make it available through a custom domain which is what I recommend. 

# ðŸ”§ TODO:

- [ ] Progress bar around photo when uploading
- [ ] First use tour
- [ ] Add photo icon overlay in edit mode
- [ ] Use pre-render SPA to make static version of page which is then served on '/'

## ðŸš§ Build Setup:
So you want to mess around with this project, cool! Setting it up is super easy! When deploying this app should be used in combination with a wildcard certificate which has become available through Let's Encrypt when they introduced ACMEv2 in March 2018.
``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
