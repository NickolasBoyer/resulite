[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NickolasBoyer/resulite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NickolasBoyer/resulite)

An easy, simple and quick online resume/personal page. Currently under heavy development but feel free to [sign up](https://beta.resulite.com/register) or contribute!

# ðŸ‘± Example:
You can check out my personal resulite page @ https://rutger.resulite.com though it is also available trough rutgerwillems.com which is how I recommend you set it up too (trough an iFrame, most hosting providers offer this option for free).  

# ðŸ”§ TODO:

- [ ] Progress bar around photo when uploading
- [ ] First use tour
- [ ] Add photo icon overlay in edit mode

## ðŸš§ Build Setup:
So you want to mess around with this project, cool! Setting it up is super easy!
``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
